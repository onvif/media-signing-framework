/**
 * @brief General description on how to integrate the signing part of ONVIF Media Signing
 *
 * Each NAL Unit in a video has to be processed for signing. The ONVIF Media Signing
 * library makes the decision whether a NAL Unit should be hashed and included in the
 * signature or not.
 *
 * ONVIF Media Signing adds SEIs of type "user data unregistered" to communicate data for
 * authentication. These SEIs are generated by the ONVIF Media Signing library and are
 * complete NAL Units + 4 start code bytes. The user is responsible for pulling these
 * generated NAL Units from the session.
 * Hence, upon a successful onvif_media_signing_add_nalu_for_signing(...) call, the user
 * should always call onvif_media_signing_get_sei(...) to fetch potentilally generated
 * SEIs.
 *
 * These generated SEIs are, by default, written with emulation prevention bytes. If
 * emulation prevention bytes will be added afterwards by the device, the user can change
 * this with the setter onvif_media_signing_set_sei_epb(...).
 *
 * To follow the H.26x standard, SEIs should be added right before the NAL Unit primary
 * slice. If the library provides multiple SEIs through the pulling procedure, they are
 * provided in the same order that they should appear in the stream. Further, these SEIs
 * can then be added to the same AU or in a later AUs.
 * For example, assume one AU with SPS, PPS and a frame consisting of two NAL Unit slices;
 * A primary slice (F0p) and a secondary slice (F0s). That is, the memory looks like
 *
 * | AUD | SPS | PPS | F0p | F0s |
 *
 * Now, assume that two SEIs are pulled from the library; F1, F2 in order. Then, if added
 * to the same AU, the memory afterwards should look like this
 *
 * | AUD | SPS | PPS | F1 | F2 | F0p | F0s |
 *
 *
 * There are a set of configuration APIs that can/should be used before the first NAL Unit
 * is added for signing:
 *   Mandatory
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_signing_key_pair(...)
 *   Optional
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_hash_algo(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_product_info(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_sei_epb(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_signing_frequency(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_max_signing_nalus(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_use_start_of_stream_sei(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_low_bitrate_mode(...)
 *     onvif_media_signing_set_max_sei_payload_size(...)
 *
 * For descriptions of the configuration APIs; See respective function below.
 *
 * To lower the bitrate increase, introduced by the SEIs, the user has two options to
 * reduce it. One is to activate the low bitrate mode (see optional calls above). The
 * other is to transmit the certificate chain in a single SEI at stream start. There is a
 * helper function to get the start-of-stream-SEI
 *   onvif_media_signing_get_start_of_stream_sei(...)
 *
 * Another helper function that can be used if a video stream is closed gracefully. If
 * there is time to wait for a final SEI when closing a stream
 *   onvif_media_signing_set_end_of_stream(...)
 * will force a final signing request.
 *
 *
 * Here is an example pseudo code of usage:
 *
 *   onvif_media_signing_t *oms = onvif_media_signing_create(OMS_CODEC_H264);
 *   if (!oms) {
 *     // Handle error
 *   }
 *   // Set manufacturer provisioned signing key pair (should always be done)
 *   if (onvif_media_signing_set_signing_key_pair(oms, private_key, private_key_size,
 *           certificate_chain, certificate_chain_size, false) != OMS_OK) {
 *     // Handle error
 *   }
 *   if (user_provisioned_signing) {
 *     if (onvif_media_signing_set_signing_key_pair(oms, user_private_key,
 *             user_private_key_size, user_certificate_chain, user_certificate_chain_size,
 *             true) != OMS_OK) {
 *       // Handle error
 *     }
 *   }
 *   // Configure session by using configuration APIs, for example
 *   if (onvif_media_signing_set_use_start_of_stream_sei(oms, use_stream_start_sei) !=
 *       OMS_OK) {
 *     // Handle error
 *   }
 *   if (use_stream_start_sei && stream_start_sei_not_loaded) {
 *     if (onvif_media_signing_get_start_of_stream_sei(oms, &stream_start_sei,
 *         &stream_start_sei_size) != OMS_OK) {
 *       // Handle error
 *     }
 *     // Add stream_start_sei to the first AU
 *   }
 *
 *   // Start session and add NAL Units repeatedly
 *   MediaSigningReturnCode status;
 *   status = onvif_media_signing_add_nalu_for_signing(oms, nalu, nalu_size, NULL);
 *   if (status != OMS_OK) {
 *     // Handle error
 *   } else {
 *     oms_sei_to_add_t sei = {0};
 *     status = onvif_media_signing_get_sei(sv, &sei);
 *     while (status == OMS_OK && sei.data != NULL) {
 *         // Prepend the latest prepended NAL Unit in the current AU with this SEI.
 *         break;

 *       // Do not forget to free the |sei.data|, since the ownership has been
 *       // transferred.
 *       // free(sei.data);
 *       status = onvif_media_signing_get_sei(sv, &sei);
 *     }
 *     // Handle return code
 *     if (status != SV_OK) {
